# LibreMiddleware Changelog

Notable user-visible changes per release. Format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) loosely.

## [Unreleased] — 4.1.0

### Added

- **PKCS#11 multi-PIN support.** Cards with multiple PIN gates (e.g.
  Serbian GEO eID with separate Authentication and Signing (QSCD)
  PINs) now expose each PIN as a distinct PKCS#11 slot. Per-slot
  login state isolates Authentication from Signing without forcing
  a single shared PIN. `C_GetSlotList` returns one slot per
  (card × PIN); single-PIN cards (rs-eid Apollo, plain PKCS#15,
  PIV) keep their single-slot shape unchanged.
- **`PKCS11Card` + `PKCS11Slot` two-tier abstraction** (mirrors
  OpenSC `sc_pkcs11_card` / `sc_pkcs11_slot`). `PKCS11Slot` owns
  per-PIN `mechanisms`, `enumerateObjects`, `signData`,
  `signWithDigestInfo`, `signatureSize`, `isLoggedIn`. Stable
  PKCS#11 slot IDs are derived via FNV-1a over
  `(reader name, PIN id, slot kind)` so the same card in the same
  reader always yields the same slot IDs.
- **Inline RESET-recovery retry-once** via `PKCS11Card::handleReset()`
  in the `C_Sign` / `C_SignFinal` paths, restoring legacy parity
  for transient PCSC `SCARD_W_RESET_CARD` faults.

### Changed

- **PKCS#11 internals refactored.** Legacy
  `smartcard::PKCS11CardProvider` interface and `SlotEntry` struct
  removed; replaced by
  `LibreSCRS::Pkcs11::Internal::PKCS11CardProvider` whose `probe()`
  returns bound `PKCS11Card` instances. C entry points reroute
  through `findSlot(slotID) → PKCS11Slot` virtual dispatch.
- **Per-slot object cache + global object handle map.** Cache is
  invalidated on both `C_Login` and `C_Logout` for symmetric
  private-object visibility on entry to and exit from the
  logged-in state.

## [Unreleased] — 4.0.0-rc2

### Added

- **Visual signature FILL_BOX layout API.** New public function
  `LibreSCRS::Signing::layoutVisualSignature(textUtf8, box)` returns
  a `VisualSignatureLayout` with auto-fit `fontSize`, `lineHeight`,
  wrapped `lines`, and a `clipped` flag. Single source of truth for
  PAdES native engine and GUI preview surfaces (LibreCelik,
  LibreMac, future LibreKDE) — preview now matches the signed PDF
  exactly. New header
  `<LibreSCRS/Signing/VisualSignatureLayout.h>`.
- **Embedded appearance-font accessor.**
  `LibreSCRS::Signing::embeddedAppearanceFontData()` returns the raw
  bytes of the bundled Liberation Sans Regular TTF as
  `std::span<const std::byte>`. GUI consumers register these bytes
  with their font system to render preview-mode appearance text in
  the same font as the embedded PDF subset.
- Standalone Qt-free example at
  `examples/visual_signature_layout/` demonstrating the layout API.
- Developer guide at
  `docs/dev-guide/visual-signature-layout-{en,sr-Cyrl,sr-Latn}.md`
  (will hand-port to the LibreSCRS.github.io Hugo site).

### Changed

- **Visual signature appearance bytes differ from 4.0.0-rc1.** The
  PAdES native emitter now auto-fits the appearance text to the
  annotation rectangle (FILL_BOX semantics) rather than emitting at
  a fixed 9 pt with no wrap. Both font size and line count are
  computed from the text + box. PDFs signed with rc1 are not
  byte-identical to PDFs signed with rc2 for the same input — this
  is by design and resolves the rc1 symptom of cert-serial overflow
  silently clipping past the annotation right edge.
- The PAdES emitter writes a `q ... re W n ... Q` clipping path
  when the layout reports `clipped == true`, so PDF viewers crop
  cleanly at the annotation rectangle.

### Removed

- Internal constants `kAppearanceFontSize`, `kAppearanceLineHeight`,
  `kAppearanceLeftMargin` in `lib/libresign/src/native/pades_module.cpp`.
  Replaced by the public sentinels in
  `<LibreSCRS/Signing/VisualSignatureLayout.h>`. Internal-only — no
  consumer impact.
